@13 = ~SHADOW RANGER : Shadow rangers are a secret sect of wanderers intimately affiliated with Shadow druids. They advocate the usage of powers of darkness and the shadows that inhabit them. They do not hesitate from resorting to Machiavellian schemes to achieve their goal. In general, they pay homage to the dark goddess, Shar and rumors say they whisper her name when they slit their target's throat in the darkness of the night.
