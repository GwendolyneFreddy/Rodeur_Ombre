## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod adds a new ranger kit in the game, restricted to lawful evil or neutral evil humans, elves and half-elves.

&nbsp;

<details><summary><ins>Description du profil</ins></summary>
<p>

SHADOW RANGER: Shadow rangers are a secret sect of wanderers intimately affiliated with Shadow druids. They advocate the usage of powers of darkness and the shadows that inhabit them. They do not hesitate from resorting to Machiavellian schemes to achieve their goal. They usually pay homage to the dark goddess, Shar, and rumors say they whisper her name when they slit their target's throat in the darkness of the night. Shadow rangers are dangerous fighters who are able to call the shadows to their aid.

Advantages:

- May cast Detect illusion once per day. Gains 1 use at 1st level and an additional use every 6 levels thereafter.
- 2d level: Gains a +5% bonus to Move Silently and Hide In Shadows. Gains an additional +5% bonus at 6th, 10th, 14th, 18th, 22th, 26th, 30th, 35th and 39th levels. 
- May use Summon Greater Shade Wolf ability once per day. Gains 1 use at 10th level and an additional use every 6 levels thereafter up to 34th level.
- May use Conjure Shadows ability once per day (calls forth 3 shadows). Gains 1 use at 15th level and an additional use at 21th and 27th levels.

Disadvantages:

- Race restricted to human, elf and half-elf.
- May only use short swords, daggers, short bows, light crossbows, sticks, darts and slings.
- May not wear metal armor.
- Alignment restricted to lawful evil and neutral evil.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BGEE), Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition (IWDEE), and the BGEE Siege of Dragonspear expansion (SoD) ; the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2, or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion ; the conversion projects <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy</a> (BGT) and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy</a> (EET).

Le Rôdeur de l'ombre is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="https://www.baldursgateworld.fr/lacouronne/modules-crees-ou-en-cours-de-developpement/12359-kit-rodeur-de-l-ombre-rodeur.html">report them on the forum</a>!

>Although it is not required for le Rôdeur de l'ombre mod to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-fr_ombre.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **fr_ombre** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG

Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Le Rôdeur de l'ombre for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: fr_ombre and a setup-fr_ombre.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-fr_ombre.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-fr_ombre.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Le Rôdeur de l'ombre for Mac OS X is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: fr_ombre folder, setup-fr_ombre and setup-fr_ombre.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-fr_ombre.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-fr_ombre.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Le Rôdeur de l'ombre for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu, weinstall and tolower to `/usr/local/bin` (create it if needed). Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run **`/usr/local/bin/tolower`** and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, type **`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`**, then run **`weinstall setup-fr_ombre`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-fr_ombre --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
